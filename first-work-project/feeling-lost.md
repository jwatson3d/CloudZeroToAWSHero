# Feeling lost, and overcoming that 
For the first time in seven years, I'm working a job I don't know how to do. So as I hear or see stuff I don't know during meetings or while working on tickets—I Google and study what's new to me. Minute by minute, I feel less lost.

Any Discovery documentation, PowerPoints, KBs (provided by the client) I have access to, I read them. I got to know the client and the project I am assigned to. I reach out to my co-workers working on the same project and shadow them when possible. I reach out to the folks who work for the client, that's working on the project and shadow them as well.
