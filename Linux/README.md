# Linux Challenges
In April 2022, I began my **FIRST** cloud role as a **Cloud Network Engineer** (AWS-focused). I had **_zero cloud certs_** and **_no previous cloud experience_**. Check out [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@giftedlane) to see how I pulled that off. Five months later, I became a **Cloud Associate Architect**.

So far, my work projects have been heavily DevOps. And I don't know DevOps. But, I learn a little about DevOps here & there as I carry out various customer asks.

I love DevOps! And I use Linux every day! So I challenged my existing Linux skills a little each day. If you're new to Linux, there may be better ways to learn Linux. Like a Linux Basics course.

## I accept your challenge!
I use [KodeKloud Engineer](https://kodekloud.com/kodekloud-engineer/) for this. First off, it's FREE. And provides a unique way to learn what it's like to work as a Systems Administrator, DevOps Engineer, and a DevOps Architect. What I enjoy about this _(course? platform? job simulator?)_ is how it tosses you into the deep end, much like a real job would do. You carry out real tasks on real systems. There's no defined list of tasks or tutorials you'll work on. You're randomly assigned random tasks to complete, like at work. Except with KodeKloud Engineer you don't have to worry about getting fired. It's a great way to get hands-on experience you can reference in a resume or job interview 😉
